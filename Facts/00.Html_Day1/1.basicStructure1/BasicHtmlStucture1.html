    <!-- STEP 1 -->
    <!--h1 is the heading tag and there are more heading tag from 1 to 6-->
    <h1>Facts-Today</h1>

    <!-- STEP 2 -->
    <!-- To write anything in Html we have many text relatedd tags
    like heading tag<h1---h6> ,label tag<label> and most used
        is paragraph tag <p>  -->

    <!-- So as we can see that our website
    will have a list of fact lets create a <p> tag to 
    store facts -->

    <!-- <p>React is being developed by Meta (formerly facebook)</p>

    <p>Millennial dads spend 3 times as much time with their kids than their fathers spent with them. In 1982, 43% of fathers had never changed a diaper. Today, that number is down to 3%</p>

    <p>Lisbon is the capital of Portugal</p> -->
        
    <!-- STEP 3 -->

    <!--Now if we see our goalSite image We can see that with our facts
    at the right side we have the genre of facts that is 
from which field the facts belong to like technology and 
society-->

    <!-- <p>React is being developed by Meta (formerly facebook)#Technology#</p> -->

    <!-- STEP 4 -->
    <!-- Now if we see that the Technology although is on the right hand side of facts 
inside image of our goal site u can see that the genre of facts are seprate element itself


so what can  we do to sort it ?
--Well we can embed another <p> tag inside primary <p> tag-->

    <!-- <p>React is being developed by Meta (formerly facebook)<p>#Technology#</p></p> -->

    <!-- STEP 5 -->
    <!-- But if we preview the above line that is :

        <p>React is being developed by Meta (formerly facebook)<p>#Technology#</p></p>


    The genre Technology is coming on to next line rather than being on the side of 
facts that's because our <p> tag and <heading tag> like <h1> to <h6> are block element 
    tag which means they take up the entire block of line to show the content inside 
of it ,

We can actually use inline tag which takes the space required to show the content-->

<!-- 
<p>React is being developed by Meta (formerly facebook)<span>#Technology#</span></p>

<p>Millennial dads spend 3 times as much time with their kids than their fathers spent with them. In 1982, 43% of fathers had never changed a diaper. Today, that number is down to 3%<span>#society#</span></p>

<p>Lisbon is the capital of Portugal<span>#society#</span></p>
-->

<!-- STEP 6 -->
<!-- But since we need a list of facts instead of paragraph
we can use the list tag:
    in html we have two type of list 1)ordered and 2)unordered

for this purpose since we dont have to number our facts 
we will use unordered list-->
<!-- <ul>
    <li><p>React is being developed by Meta (formerly facebook)<span>#Technology#</span></p></li>
    <li><p>Millennial dads spend 3 times as much time with their kids than their fathers spent with them. In 1982, 43% of fathers had never changed a diaper. Today, that number is down to 3%<span>#society#</span></p></li>
    <li><p>Lisbon is the capital of Portugal<span>#society#</span></p></li>
</ul> -->


<!-- STEP 7 -->
<!-- Now if we see goal image we have a (Source) hypertext which 
    redirects to another site Now that (Source) is attached with our fact
that is it is inside our <p> tag with fact under list
    
for hypertext we use <a> anchor tag with href attribute like:
    <a href="link"></a>-->

    <!-- <ul>
        <li><p>React is being developed by Meta (formerly facebook)<a href="https://opensource.fb.com/">(Source)</a><span>#Technology#</span></p></li>
        
    </ul> -->

<!-- STEP 8 -->
    <!-- Now the problem with above hypertext is 
    when we click the link it opens up in the same tab
as of our actual main site we can change it to
open in new tab  using target attribute of <a>
    anchor tag and set it _blank which means open in new
blank tab -->


<ul>
    <li><p>React is being developed by Meta (formerly facebook)<a href="https://opensource.fb.com/" target="_blank">(Source)</a><span>#Technology#</span></p></li>
    
</ul>
